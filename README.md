# Notion AutoEmoji
Intelligently chosen emojis for your Notion pages. Powered by LLMs. 

When you select 'Add Icon' to a Notion page, a _random_ emoji is assigned to it. I figured I could overengineer a solution by letting a state-of-the-art LLM pick one instead.


### Prerequisites

- openai (`pip install openai`)
- notion (`pip install notion`)
